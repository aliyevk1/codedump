# CodeDump 🗑️

Welcome to **CodeDump**, my glorious pile of half-baked ideas and micro-projects that didn’t quite deserve their own repos. This is where code goes when it’s *too functional to delete* but *too embarrassing to show recruiters*.

### What is this?

A personal landfill of front-end experiments, weekend tinkering, and those 2 AM “this might be cool” projects. Each one sits in its own folder under `/projects/`, blissfully unaware of version control best practices.

### Current Residents

* **BudgetWise** — a shockingly decent budget tracker that ditched databases for localStorage because simplicity won. 50/30/20 rule, mobile-first, Apple-ish.

### How to Explore

1. Open [`index.html`](./index.html).
2. Click whatever sounds least likely to crash.
3. Enjoy (or regret).

### Why this exists

Because sometimes you just want to code without writing 17 config files or pretending to architect a SaaS.

### Contributing

No. This is a personal dump. You don’t contribute to a landfill.

### License

Probably MIT. I’m too lazy to check. Use whatever you want, but don’t blame me when it explodes.

**TL;DR:** Stupid simple, vibes-coded, no build steps, no shame (okay, maybe a little).
